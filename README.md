Our project is an interactive web application that simulates transportation routes across Asia cities. Users can explore various transport modes, including sea, air, and land, with customizable speed settings. The app visualizes routes between cities, tracks vehicle movements, and calculates shipping times. A crisis simulation feature allows users to "destroy" cities or routes, testing the impact of disruptions. We integrate with OpenAI to provide optimized alternative routes and solutions based on cost, time, and environmental impact. Our project demonstrates real-time data visualization, interactive simulation, and AI-powered analysis for logistics optimization.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory  
Find the **CantCodeDenSleep** folder where youâ€™ve stored the project.

\`\`\`bash
cd CantCodeDenSleep
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Open the Terminal  
Launch the terminal:
- **Windows**: Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- **Mac**: Terminal.
- **VS Code**: Use the terminal from the top bar.


### Step 3: Key in Open AI API key  
Go to CantCodeDenSleep/src/AsiaWebmap6/line 9

const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'Key_in_your_OPENAI_API_KEY_here';

Change to your OpenAI API Key

### Step 4: Install Dependencies  
Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Start the Project  
Once the installation is done, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

The simulation will now be live, and you can start solving transportation crises. Happy Destroying (âœ˜) Simulating (âœ“)!
